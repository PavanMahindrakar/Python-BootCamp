#tuple unpacking allows you to assign the elements of a tuple to multiple variables in a single statement.
# This is useful for extracting values from a tuple without needing to access each element individually.
# Example of tuple unpacking

marks = (25, 55, 40)
a , b , c = marks
print(a, b, c)  # Output: 25 55 40
