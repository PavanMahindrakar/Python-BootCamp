print(name[0])  # Accessing the first character
print(name[1])  # Accessing the second character    
print(name[2])  # Accessing the third character
print(name[3])  # Accessing the fourth character
print(name[4])  # Accessing the fifth character

# Accessing characters using negative indexing
print(name[-1])  # Accessing the last character (-1 + length of string)
print(name[-2])  # Accessing the second last character  (-2 + length of string)
print(name[-3])  # Accessing the third last character  (-3 + length of string)
print(name[-4])  # Accessing the fourth last character (-4 + length of string)
print(name[-5])  # Accessing the fifth last character    (-5 + length of string)

#negative indexing is (-1 + length of string)
